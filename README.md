## About

The task is to create a car insurance api.

## API(s) to Implement
### API 1. Convert "Model" and "Year" of a car to a suggested "Car Value"

This API takes 2 parameters as input in JSON format that includes - the "model" (e.g. "Civic") and a numeric "year" of a car (e.g. 2014).  And the output is a JSON format with the suggested value for the car, such as "$6,614".  Here are the example specifications and business rules of conversion:

#### EXAMPLE
INPUT	OUTPUT	ERROR OUTPUT
{ model: "Civic"; year: 2014 }	{ car_value: 6614 }	{ error: "there is an error"}
 

#### BUSINESS RULES

Car_value is calculated by adding up the positions of alphabets of the letters in the name, times a hundred, and add the year value.  Position of alphabet means the letter in the order of alphabets (e.g. A is the first letter, so it is 1.  Z is the last letter, so it is 26).  Space and any other signs are ignored.   For example, a "Civic" in year 2014 will be worth (3 + 9 + 22 + 9 + 3) * 100 + 2014 = $6,614.  If input values are not valid, return an error.

### API 2. Convert "Claim History" to a "Risk Rating"

This API takes 1 parameters as input in JSON format that has a text field describing the claim history in the last 3 years of a driver requesting for a quote.  The output is a JSON format with the suggested rating of the driver from 1 to 5, 5 being a high risk driver and 1 being a low risk driver.  Here are the example specifications and business rules of conversion:
 
#### EXAMPLE
INPUT	OUTPUT	ERROR OUTPUT
{ claim_history: "My only claim was a crash into my house's garage door that left a scratch on my car.  There are no other crashes." }	{ risk_rating: 3 }	{ error: "there is an error"}
 

#### BUSINESS RULES

Risk rating is calculated by counting the number of occurrences of a list of keywords.  Each occurrence (regardless of whether they are repeats) will add 1 to the risk rating.  The keyword list is "collide", "crash", "scratch", "bump", "", and "smash".  For example, "My only claim was a crash into my house's garage door that left a scratch on my car. There are no other crashes." returns a rating of 3 (counting the underlined letters).  If input value is not valid, return an error.

### API 3. Convert "Car Value" and "Risk Rating" to a "Quote"

This API takes 2 parameters as input in JSON format that includes - the "car value" (e.g. $6,614) and "risk rating" of the driver between 1 to 5 (e.g. 5 meaning high risk).  And the output is a JSON format with the suggested monthly and yearly premium for the insurance policy, such as "$50", "$614,".  Here are the example specifications and business rules of conversion:

#### EXAMPLE
INPUT	OUTPUT	ERROR OUTPUT
{ car_value: 6614; risk_rating: 5}	{ monthly_premium: 27.5; yearly_premium: 330}	{ error: "there is an error"}
 

#### BUSINESS RULES

Yearly premium is calculated by car_value multiplied by driver rating divided by 100.   For example, car value of $6,614 and driver rating of 5, the yearly premium will be $6,614 * 5 / 100 = $330.  The monthly premium is the yearly premium divided by 12.  So the monthly premium in this example will be $300 /12 = $27.5.  If input values are not valid, return an error.
## Technologies Used

- NodeJS - Javascript Runtime Environment
- ExpressJS - Web Application Framework
- Typescript - Type safety
- Zod - Runtime type checker & removes duplicate type declaration
- ts-node - JIT Typescript to Javascript node server
- Jest - Testing framework
- SuperTest - Tests http requests

## How to run tests

1) Install packages
```
npm install
```

2) Run tests
```
npm test
```
